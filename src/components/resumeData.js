    "aboutme":"I'm a Information Technology Bachelor, and a programming enthusiast. As a little child I was overwhelmed by Computers and I always wanted to know how the box works under the hood. As I explored Computers, with twelve years as a kid I began to explore the websites, and by even not understanding how the web works I managed to make a php website with a phpbb2 forum and it acctually worked. Later on after my University graduation I started to work in a Company which gave me the task of a Junior Frontend Developer. Armed with the experience they gave and taught me, I started to dig deeper in the world of javascript frameworks like react, angular 2(today angular 7), and polymer.js which made me fall in love with progressive web apps. Moving on to the peroid of now, I have also managed to get some experience with c# and xamarin to build simple but effective crossplatform mobile apps. I never actually did stop investing time into node.js and javascript.",
